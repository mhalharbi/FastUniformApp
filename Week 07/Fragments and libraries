This week the focus was creating an UI that creates the detailed lists of all the products that be sold in the Fast Uniforms android app design (Fast Uniforms UI designs elements). Using Recyclerview to generate the order detailed product listings for the cart description detailed design. 
Fragments and libraries;
    7.1 Ballon plugin - used to generate the profiles of the users within the Fast uniforms apps and thus we need to add dependencies in the gradle files. 
    7.2 Recycler view - The recycler view helps create the fast uniform product management dsahboard and appropriate mechanism to add files to the cart order.
