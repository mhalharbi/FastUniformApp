This week the focus was creating an UI that creates the detailed lists of all the products that be sold in the Fast Uniforms android app design (Fast Uniforms UI designs elements). Using Recyclerview to generate the order detailed product listings for the cart description detailed design. 
Fragments and libraries;
    7.1 Ballon plugin - used to generate the profiles of the users within the Fast uniforms apps and thus we need to add dependencies in the gradle files. 
    7.2 Recycler view - The recycler view helps create the fast uniform product management dsahboard and appropriate mechanism to add files to the cart order. 
    
In summary, this week
    1.  I entirely focused on implementation of libraries and how to insert the library in the gradle files and thus implement robust project implementation design for the project product listings.
    2. Using the appropriate recyclerview to generate a perfect adapter classes that stores the product bitmap data and the descriptive textual data elements. 
    3. Implementation of android libraries such as balloon android library and recyclerview components.
